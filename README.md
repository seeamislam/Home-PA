**Overview**

In recent years, smart home systems have exploded in popularity. With different services such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa, home security has never been more accessible. Home security
and surveillance concern all homeowners, but currently, there are no effective platforms to manage different smart products without opening the product's respective proprietary app.
Home PA eliminates the need of downloading multiple apps and allows you to manage all your smart home devices in one single voice platform using Google Home or Amazon Alexa. Home-PA can help you get information 
about the last time someone opened your main door, status of backyard motion (if a motion detection camera is installed) and much more!
