# Home-PA

> A SmartHome Assistant developed at HackTheNorth 2019

**Overview**

Smart home systems are getting ever the more popular and hitting the mainstream with Smart speakers such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa being commonly found in Canadian households. Home security
and surveillance are things of concern to many users but currently there is no effective way to manage different smart products without opening the proprietary apps for the devices.
Home PA eliminates the need of multiple apps and allows you to manage all your smart home devices in one single voice platform using Google Home or Amazon Alexa. Home-PA can help you get information 
about the last time someone opened your main door, status of backyard motion(if motion detection camera is installed) and many more!
